# Flask App Initializer

Project to create boilerplate for a Flask app

I was learning Flask and kept having to look up the folder and file structure to get an app up. Decided to create a single function that can create all files and directories needed to get an app running. 

Went ahead and made an interactive function as well using Rich for pretty inputs.

This was also an exercise in strutcuring a python project for myself.


## To Run

Run either `create_flask.py` or `create_flask_interactive.py`

# Flask-Dash Branch

For the branch flask-dask I took a different organizational approach of a template which would be altered.

This makes more sense for the type of project this became. The flask-dash branch imbeds a dash app in a flask app as an endpoint `/dashapp`
